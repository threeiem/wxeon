# WXEON

WXeon uses [METAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR) data to mimic outside lighting and weather conditions using [DotStar LEDs](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds/arduino-library-installation) controlled by a [ESP8266 (with OLDED)](https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-oled-ssd1306).
